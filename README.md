# stuntkey

**Keep your API keys out of your coding agent's context.** Your agent calls the
API; it never sees the key. A leaked transcript leaks nothing.

Secretless credential brokering for AI coding agents, plus a scanner for keys
that have already leaked into the files your agent reads.

### Measured, not asserted

`leakbench` is a vendor-neutral benchmark of 61 ways an AI coding agent leaks a
credential — reading `.env`, dumping the environment, printing a traceback,
following an injected instruction. Run it yourself: `python -m leakbench`.

| Protection | blocked | masked | leaked |
|---|---|---|---|
| nothing | 0 | 0 | **54** |
| stuntkey | **44** | 12 | **5** |

**The 5 stuntkey does not stop**, named rather than hidden:
`node-prints-process-env`, `script-prints-environ`, `script-reads-env-file`,
`runaway-loop-no-cap`, `unbounded-retry` — a program you wrote, run by the
agent, printing its own environment. No hook can see inside that.

Threat model: [docs/THREAT_MODEL.md](docs/THREAT_MODEL.md). Known gaps and
limits: [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) — including that stuntkey has not had a paid
external security review, and what we do instead.

- The key sits in your computer's own keychain. When your AI needs an API, it asks stuntkey to make the call, and stuntkey adds the key itself.
- Replies are cleaned of the key. In a brokered call, anything other than a read (GET) waits for your click. Every call is logged.
- Plain Python, no extra packages. No account, no server, no cloud.
- Formerly OathKey (and before that SafeEasyAPI).

![Recording of a terminal running stuntkey --version, list, selftest and audit show. The output is real; the demo does not show saving a key.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calasdan-sketch/stuntkey/main/docs/demo.svg)

## Start here (four steps)

Need pipx? https://pipx.pypa.io

```
pipx install stuntkey
stuntkey get github            # opens the key page; you click Copy; stuntkey tests the key and saves it
stuntkey install               # plug stuntkey into Claude, Cursor or VS Code, then restart that app
stuntkey doctor                # health check; "AI tools: plugged into ..." means it is connected
```

When a key page asks which permissions to give, pick read-only or the minimum it offers.

Now ask your AI: *"Who am I on GitHub?"* The AI asks stuntkey for `GET /user`; stuntkey makes the call with your key and hands back only the answer. The first time, a window asks you to allow GitHub reads for this session. To see what it did: `stuntkey audit show`.

> No `pipx`? `pip install stuntkey` works too. Or download `stuntkey.pyz` from the latest release and run `python stuntkey.pyz doctor`. Latest unreleased code: `pipx install git+https://github.com/calasdan-sketch/stuntkey`.
> Needs Python 3.10 or newer. On Linux the keychain needs `secret-tool` (package `libsecret-tools`). If your computer says `stuntkey` is not found, close the window and open a new one, or run `python -m stuntkey`.

## When your AI writes normal code

Asking stuntkey to make a call works when the AI talks to stuntkey (through MCP or `serve`). If instead your AI writes an ordinary program that uses a vendor's SDK (for example `openai.OpenAI()` reading `OPENAI_API_KEY`), run that program through the proxy:

```
stuntkey proxy -- python app.py
```

The program gets `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `GROQ_BASE_URL` and `TOGETHER_BASE_URL` pointing at a local stuntkey address on this computer, and its `*_API_KEY` is a throwaway password for that address, not your key. stuntkey adds the real key on the way out and scrubs it from the answers. If stuntkey stops, the program's calls fail instead of going out on their own. `--print-env` prints the variables for a tool you start yourself. There is no certificate trickery: this works only for SDKs that let you change their base address (OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Together); other vendors stay on brokered calls. Proxy mode does **not** ask for a click per call, unlike a brokered call: a chat prompt is far too long for anyone to read in a confirmation window. Instead it sends `POST` only to the usual AI endpoints (chat, responses, messages, embeddings) and refuses every other write unless an `stuntkey.policy` file you approved allows it. Streamed answers get the key-scrubber but not the whole-body disguise check a brokered call adds.

For other programs, `stuntkey run openai -- python app.py` puts the key in that one program's environment only and scrubs it from the program's output. That program does see the key, so use `run` yourself; do not hand it to an AI that can run shell commands.

## The permission windows

stuntkey asks you, not the AI, before anything risky. The question appears in a window from your operating system (outside the AI app, so the AI cannot type the answer):

- **Windows:** a standard message box titled "stuntkey - permission needed". No is the default button.
- **macOS:** a system dialog. **Linux:** a `zenity` or `kdialog` window, if one is installed in a system folder.
- **When it asks:** the first read of each service in an AI session (one yes covers that service's reads until the AI app restarts), and every write, change or delete (each one, showing the method, address, query and whole body).
- **No answer** in 2 minutes counts as no. Three refusals stop further requests for that session.
- **No window possible** (SSH, WSL or Linux without a desktop, a headless server): stuntkey asks on the terminal instead and you type a 4-digit code shown only there. If there is no terminal either, or a window helper is installed but cannot open, the answer is no. On WSL a window works only if WSLg (or another display) and `zenity`/`kdialog` are set up.
- **Agent key capture** (`capture_key`, below) asks in its own window, which says it closes by itself after 5 minutes. With no window possible, it relies on a grant you made in the terminal with `stuntkey allow-agent <service>`.

## Why not just put the key in a `.env` file?

AI coding tools read files in your project, and they paste what they read into a chat that someone else's computer sees. A key in a file, a chat or a config can leak in seconds. With stuntkey the key stays in your computer's keychain and stuntkey adds it to each request, so the AI does not receive it through stuntkey. `stuntkey get` will not leave a key in a file in your project folder unless you agree to the fallback (it asks first, and only when no keychain works).

## How it works

1. **You save a key once** (`stuntkey get <service>`). It goes into the Windows, Mac or Linux keychain. stuntkey tests it with a harmless call first.
2. **Your AI asks for an action**, not a key: "GET /user on GitHub". It can only name the service, the method, the path and the data.
3. **stuntkey makes the call itself**, to the service's real address only, adds the key, and hands back the answer with the key scrubbed out.

`stuntkey call` is you making the same brokered call by hand, with no AI involved.

## What stuntkey does not do

It reduces risk; it does not remove it, and no independent security review has been done yet.

- **It does not stop an AI misusing a key it is allowed to use.** Once you allow GitHub reads, the AI can read whatever that key can read. Give each key only the permissions it needs, at the provider.
- **It does not protect against malware, or an AI that can run programs as you.** Anything running as your user can read your keychain, edit the log and click the windows. Run risky agents in a separate account or container.
- **It does not hide the data.** Replies from the API go to your AI, and so to the AI company. The key is scrubbed; the rest is not.
- **It does not protect `run`.** A program started with `run` holds the key and can print it.
- **It does not catch every disguise.** Scrubbing is best effort.
- **The Claude Code hook masks Bash output only.** Claude Code documents no output shape for Read or Grep, so the hook cannot mask them: it refuses Read of private keys, credentials files and files holding a key you stored instead. A key stuntkey never stored, in a format it does not know, in an ordinary file, still reaches the AI through Read. A script the AI writes is checked only when it runs through Bash. Scores per leak are in [leakbench/README.md](https://github.com/calasdan-sketch/stuntkey/blob/main/leakbench/README.md).
- **The clipboard.** `get` empties it right away, but other programs or clipboard-history tools may see the key while it is there.
- **A log that can't be rewritten.** The log shows accidents and casual edits. Someone running as you could rewrite it.
- **It sends no telemetry.** stuntkey talks only to the services you call (and, for `find`, a public list on GitHub).

The threat model, with links to the code that does each job, is in [docs/THREAT_MODEL.md](https://github.com/calasdan-sketch/stuntkey/blob/main/docs/THREAT_MODEL.md). More known limits (a GET can read other secrets through a vendor's own endpoints, and others) are under "Known limits" in [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/calasdan-sketch/stuntkey/blob/main/SECURITY.md), which is also where to report a security problem privately.

## Check it yourself (don't trust us)

| Command | What it shows |
|---|---|
| `stuntkey selftest` | Runs stuntkey's rules against simulated attacks, using a made-up key and a pretend server: a server that echoes the key in disguise, tricky addresses, names that point inside your network, writes without permission, edits to the log. Prints how many it stopped (`--verbose` lists each) and exits with an error if any gets through. It does not test the live network layer, so treat it as a check of the rules, not a security audit. |
| `stuntkey doctor` | One-paste health check: keychain, activity log, which AI tools it is plugged into, and a quick self-attack run. |
| `stuntkey scan` | Finds API keys lying in your project files and AI-tool settings, including the MCP server configs of Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, Codex, Gemini and Zed (`--no-mcp` skips those). It prints only a shortened form of each key. `--bundle dist/` or `--bundle https://your-app.com` shows secret keys your website ships to every visitor (`VITE_`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_`, `REACT_APP_`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_` and known key formats). |
| `stuntkey scan-git` | Looks through git history for keys; `--staged` checks only what is about to be committed, `--install-hook` blocks such commits. |
| `stuntkey audit verify` | Checks the activity log was not edited, cut short or deleted. If it did not check out, `audit reset` starts a fresh log and keeps the old one. |

stuntkey uses only Python's own standard library, and a test in the repository ([tests/test_stdlib_only.py](https://github.com/calasdan-sketch/stuntkey/blob/main/tests/test_stdlib_only.py)) fails if that ever changes.

## Commands

**Start**

- `get <service>` - one command: opens the key page, takes the key when you click Copy (then empties the clipboard), tests it, saves it in the keychain. `--no-clipboard` uses hidden typing instead.
- `install` / `uninstall` - plug stuntkey into (or remove it from) Claude Desktop, Cursor, Claude Code and VS Code.
- `doctor` - the health check above.
- `start` - a short guided tour: what is connected and what to do next.
- `start --simple` - for apps made with Lovable, Bolt, Replit or Vercel: one plain question at a time. It gets your key, shows where to paste it in your host's secret settings (never in a `VITE_` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_` setting), then checks your live site does not hand the key to visitors.
- `list` - the services it knows.

**Daily**

- `call <service> <METHOD> <path>` - make one brokered call yourself (`--query name=value`, `--data '{...}'`, `--json`). Try `stuntkey call github GET /user`.
- `overview` - what is connected and whether the activity log is intact. (`status` shows where each key lives and how old it is.)
- `audit show` - the last calls, with a warning if the log does not check out.
- `rotate <service>` - replace a stored key.
- `panic <service> [--dry-run]` - "I leaked a key": asks first, revokes it (GitHub and Vercel through their official API; others open the revoke page and wait for you), gets a new one with the `get` flow, then shows where the old key is still written (project, .env, MCP configs, git history). Terminal only - never offered to an agent.
- `caps set openai --calls-day 500 --tokens-day 200000 --calls-session 100` - a spending limit per key, counted across every program using it (`--clear` removes it; `caps show` lists them). The limit can be passed by one call already in flight.
- `stop` / `resume` - a kill switch: `stop` refuses every brokered and proxied call at once; `resume` (asks you first) lets them through again.
- `policy show` / `policy approve` - an `stuntkey.policy` file lists the methods and paths each service may use. A project's file can only narrow your own. A new or changed file is obeyed only after you approve it.
- `forget <service>` - remove a stored key.

**Security**

- `selftest`, `doctor`, `scan`, `scan-git`, `hook` (stops Claude Code reading `.env` files and running stuntkey commands that use a key; it blocks the call if it breaks, unless you install it with `hook install --fail-open`) as above.

**Advanced**

- `run <service> -- <command>` - run a program with the key in its environment (see "When your AI writes normal code"). For you, not for an AI with a shell.
- `serve` - a local web door for AI tools that cannot use MCP (OpenAI-style functions, Ollama, scripts).
- `mcp` - the MCP server your AI app starts for you. Besides brokered calls it has `capture_key`: your AI opens the key page, you click Copy, and stuntkey takes the key from the clipboard without passing it to the AI. You allow this per service with `allow-agent <service>`.
- `init` / `setup` - write `stuntkey.json` for a project, then connect every service it needs.
- `remote`, `trust-server`, `deploy` - use a key on your own server over ssh.
- `wrap <client> <server>` - move a key out of an MCP server's settings into the keychain; the server is then started through `stuntkey run`. `--all --dry-run` previews every server, `--undo` restores the old settings, `--file` picks a config file.
- `proxy -- <command>` - see "When your AI writes normal code".
- `add` - make your own service recipe. `find` - look for free public APIs.

Coming from `oathkey` (0.8)? The first run copies `~/.oathkey` to `~/.stuntkey` (the old folder stays), old `oathkey.json` / `oathkey.policy` files are still read, and `stuntkey doctor` points at what is left: `stuntkey migrate` copies saved keychain keys to the new names and reads each one back (add `--remove-old` to then delete the old entries), and `stuntkey install` / `stuntkey hook install` replace old `oathkey` hook and MCP entries after showing the change and asking (`hook install --yes` skips the question). Coming from the older `safeeasyapi` name? Nothing is migrated from it: re-run `stuntkey get <service>` and `stuntkey install`, and remove any old `safeeasyapi` hook or MCP entry by hand.

Many commands accept `--json` (try `list`, `overview`, `selftest`, `doctor`, `audit`). Exit codes: 0 fine, 1 problem, 2 wrong usage, 3 service not found, 5 refused by policy, 7 network problem.

## Services

36 services are built in, from GitHub and Stripe to OpenAI and AWS. `stuntkey list` shows them all.

Not listed? `stuntkey add` makes a recipe in a minute. A recipe cannot send a built-in service's key to a different server. To share a recipe with everyone, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/calasdan-sketch/stuntkey/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

The longer user guide (every flag, where keys are stored, two-value keys, testing) is in [docs/guide.md](https://github.com/calasdan-sketch/stuntkey/blob/main/docs/guide.md).
