"""Secret storage: .env handling with locked-down permissions.

Rules:
- The key value is NEVER printed, logged, or returned to callers.
- The file is private from its first byte: the content is written to a
  randomly named temp file created with O_CREAT|O_EXCL and mode 0o600 in
  the same directory, fsync'd, then atomically renamed over the target.
  There is no moment at which a partial or world-readable .env exists,
  and a pre-planted file (or link) at a guessable name is never written
  through.
- Existing keys are updated in place (``export KEY=`` lines included);
  nothing else in the file moves - not even a byte of it. A variable set
  more than once is updated on its LAST line - the one python-dotenv,
  docker compose and a shell ``source`` end up using - and the earlier
  lines are left alone; ``forget`` removes every one of them. Every
  other line comes back out exactly as it went in: a Windows cp1252 file
  with an accented comment stays cp1252 (bytes that are not UTF-8
  survive through ``surrogateescape``), and every line keeps its own
  line ending - a CRLF file stays CRLF, an LF file stays LF. The line we
  add or change takes the file's own style, and a missing last newline
  is added in that style.
- A quoted value that runs over several lines belongs to its variable, as
  python-dotenv, Node dotenv and a shell read it: a line inside it that
  looks like ``NAME=`` is never rewritten or removed, and a variable whose
  own value runs over several lines is replaced or removed as a whole.
- A ``.env`` that is a symbolic link is refused (``refuse_link``): never
  written through, never silently replaced. So is a file that is not plain
  text (UTF-16 from PowerShell's ``>``), because appending UTF-8 to it
  would wreck it. Both refusals change nothing and say why.
- Values are written so that sourcing the file in a shell can never run
  anything, and so that no reader loses part of the key: a value made only
  of ``[A-Za-z0-9_.+/=:-]`` is written bare; anything else is wrapped in
  single quotes, inside which a POSIX shell takes every character
  literally (inside double quotes it would still run ``$(...)`` and
  backticks). A value that readers do not agree on - one with a single
  quote, a backslash, ``${`` or a character that cannot be seen - is
  refused (``UnsafeValue``) instead of being written in a form some reader
  would misread; real API keys have none of these. Files written by 0.3.1
  and earlier used double quotes: they are still read, and a line is
  rewritten in the new form the next time its key is saved.
- On Windows, mode bits are meaningless; the file's ACL is reduced to
  the current user instead (best effort, via icacls) — and the success
  line says so honestly when that did not work.
