"""Questions asked right after a key was handled: answered without echo, and
never treating a pasted key as an answer.

A person who has just copied a key, and is then asked "Is that the key?",
may paste it AT that question. An ordinary prompt shows what is typed or
pasted, so the key ended up on screen (and in a screenshot). Here the answer
is read the way a password is: nothing is shown. Only Enter, y and n mean
anything; text that is long or looks like a key is refused with a plain
sentence that does not repeat it, and is dropped, not kept or logged.
