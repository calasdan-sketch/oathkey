"""Copy-and-go: take a key from the clipboard the moment it is copied.

The person clicks the vendor's own "Copy" button; this notices a new,
key-shaped value on the clipboard, takes it and EMPTIES the clipboard, so
the key is not left there for the next paste or another program. Nothing
is typed or pasted, and the value is never shown.

It only looks while `stuntkey connect --clipboard` is waiting for a key,
and only takes a value that:
  - matches the field's pattern, when the recipe gives one; otherwise
  - looks like a key: one line, no spaces, 16 to 4096 visible characters,
    and different from what was on the clipboard when it started waiting
    and from the values already taken for this connect.

Backends: Windows (user32, no extra tools), macOS (pbpaste / pbcopy),
Linux (wl-paste / wl-copy, xclip or xsel). With none available, connect
falls back to the hidden paste prompt. Windows clipboard history (Win+V)
and clipboard managers can keep their own copy; this cannot clear those.
