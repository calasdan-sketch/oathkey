"""`stuntkey allow-agent <service>`: the person's one-time yes to agent-driven capture.

It only runs in a real terminal and asks for a typed "yes", so an agent that
can run shell commands cannot grant itself the permission (the hook also
refuses the command). The grant lives in the user's home folder
(~/.stuntkey/agent-consent.json), not in the project: a file the project's
own tools can edit could not be trusted to say the person agreed.

  You are about to let an AI agent get a {display} key for THIS project
  ({project}) without you copying or pasting anything.

  What happens: the agent opens {display}'s key page in your browser and clicks
  the Copy button. This program then takes the key off your clipboard, EMPTIES the
  clipboard, tests the key with {display}, and stores it as {env_var}. The agent
  is told only that it is stored - never the key.

  What it cannot do: log in for you, answer 2FA, or type passwords - you do
  that in the browser when asked. While it is waiting (up to 3 minutes) do not
  copy anything else.
