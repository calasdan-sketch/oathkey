"""What an AI agent may ask for, and the only things it gets back.

The handshake: the agent says WHICH key it needs; a person gets the key from
the vendor into the project using `stuntkey connect`. The agent never
sees, reads or writes a key, so a key is never in its chat or its logs.

Every answer here is built from a short fixed list of fields - a service
name, a variable NAME, a status word, a sentence for the human - and is then
passed through guard_text(), which blanks any secret value this process can
reach (a variable in its environment, a value in the project's .env), in its
raw form and the common re-writings (redact.py). It is two locks: the answer
is never built from a value, and if one ever got in, it would be removed.
