"""`oathkey hook`: stop an AI agent reading your .env files.

Claude Code can run a small program before every tool call (a "PreToolUse
hook") and that program can say no. `hook install` adds one to Claude Code's
settings; `hook check` is that program. When the agent tries to Read, Grep,
or run a Bash, PowerShell or Monitor command that touches a .env file, or
tries to Edit, Write, MultiEdit or NotebookEdit one, the answer is "deny" and
the reason is handed back to the agent in plain words.

This is a guardrail, not a sandbox. It catches the direct ways (cat .env,
Read .env, grep KEY .env, source .env). A determined or confused program can
still build a file name out of pieces, sweep a folder (`grep -r KEY .`) or go
through a tool this hook is not attached to; keep keys out of the files too
(`oathkey connect <service> --store keychain`). The README lists what it
does NOT stop.

Two safety rules for the code below:
* Nothing read from a settings file is ever executed. `hook status` runs only
  the command THIS install would generate, never one it found in a file (a
  cloned repository's .claude/settings.json is not trusted).
* Our own entry is recognised by a marker or by an exact command, never by
  "it looks like ours", and `install` always writes into a group of its own.

The hook format lives in decision_json() and the settings shape in
hook_handler() / hook_entry(): the places to change if Claude Code changes
either. Checked against https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks (see the
README for what could not be confirmed).
