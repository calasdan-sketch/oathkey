# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **New: local recipes.** A recipe with `"local": true` may use plain http, but every
  address in it must be this computer (127.0.0.1, localhost or [::1]), so the key never
  leaves the machine. For AI routers on your PC such as freellmapi or OmniRoute: save the
  key with `oathkey get`, use it with `oathkey run`. `oathkey call` still only reaches
  public https servers.

## 0.8.0

oathkey joins two lines of work: the key-capture line (0.7.x: `capture_key`,
`allow-agent`, the consent window, the Claude Code hook, `oathkey.json`) and the
call-broker line.

- **New: your AI can use a key without holding it.** `oathkey call`, the MCP
  `call_api` tool and `oathkey serve` make the request for the AI: the real
  address only (https, public servers only, no redirects), the key added by
  oathkey, any trace of the key removed from the answer. Writes wait for your click.
- **New: tamper-evident activity log** (`audit verify|show|reset`).
- **New: `oathkey selftest`**: 73 simulated attacks against oathkey's own rules.
  It does not test the live network layer and is not a security audit.
- **New: `install` / `uninstall`** into Claude Desktop, Cursor, Claude Code and VS Code,
  plus `remote`, `trust-server`, `deploy`, `start`, `overview`.
- **New: `scan-git`** (git history and a pre-commit hook). `scan` is unchanged.
- **Changed names:** the product is `oathkey`; `status` is the project key report
  and the connection summary is `overview`.
- **Changed:** a custom recipe may replace a built-in one only if it talks to the
  same server; otherwise it is ignored with a message.
- **Changed: the Claude Code hook is stricter.** It now also watches MCP tool calls
  (every text in their arguments), refuses an agent running `oathkey remote`,
  `deploy`, `trust-server`, `export`, `run`, `serve` or `call`, refuses wildcard
  paths that could expand to `~/.oathkey` (`~/.*/keys/x`), refuses writes to
  `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/settings.local.json`, `~/.claude.json` and
  `.mcp.json`, refuses a shell command over 100,000 characters unread, and
  `hook install` now blocks the call if the hook itself fails (`--fail-open` to
  opt out). Run `oathkey hook install` again to update an installed hook.
- **Changed: sending a key to a server asks in a pop-up window** that shows the
  server's key fingerprint (the terminal only when no window can be shown); the
  key-bearing ssh connection then accepts only the key you confirmed
  (`StrictHostKeyChecking=yes`). `export --yes` counts only at a real terminal;
  elsewhere a window must be clicked.
- **Changed: `install` and `setup-agent` write `--default-store keychain`**, and the
  MCP server defaults to the keychain when there is one, so a key an AI captures
  is one `call_api` can use. `rotate` replaces the key where it is stored.
  An unknown service name exits 3 with a "Did you mean" line.
- **Fixed:** `oathkey start`; `remote ... -- cmd` after `--project-dir`; the web door
  binds its port exclusively on Windows; the pop-up helper runs with a fixed
  environment. Known limits are listed in SECURITY.md.
- **A fresh start for the rename.** Nothing is migrated from the old `safeeasyapi`
  names: no data, keychain entries or settings. To move over, re-run
  `oathkey get <service>` and `oathkey install`, and remove any old `safeeasyapi`
  hook or MCP entry by hand.
- No independent security review has been done yet.

## 0.7.5

After the owner said "my AI assistant" sounded fraudulent.

- **The window names who is asking.** The MCP client's own name from `initialize`
  (`clientInfo.name`) is shown: *Claude Code wants to connect GitHub for "my-shop".*
  Known names get friendly forms (Claude Code, Claude, Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI,
  Windsurf, Cline, Zed, VS Code ...); an unknown name is shown cleaned (ASCII, 30
  characters); none at all is "An AI program". It is what the program reports about
  itself - said in the README and SKILL, not in the window.
- **Line 1 says who made the tool:** *oathkey (free key-safe tool, made by Calas
  Automations, installed on this computer)*. New `oathkey about` and a README
  section on checking it is the real program (`pip show`, PyPI, GitHub).
- **A dead stored key is not protected by a question.** Before the REPLACE window the
  stored key is tested with the vendor; if the vendor rejects it, the replace question is
  skipped (normal capture, `stored_key_note` tells the agent). Untestable keys still get
  the replace window.
- **A closed window is never a remembered No.** The No button is told apart from a
  closed window where the platform allows it (macOS no longer has a cancel button; zenity
  uses two extra buttons); where it cannot (kdialog, old zenity) a silent exit is passed
  on as a No but is not remembered for 10 minutes. Expired and closed windows are
  `consent_expired`.

## 0.7.4

A plain-words pass on the windows, after a real person used 0.7.3 on Windows.

- **Wording.** Every window is at most five short lines, in everyday words, and says
  what is going on first: *oathkey (installed on this computer) asks: Your AI
  assistant wants to connect GitHub for "my-shop". oathkey will save the key
  safely; the assistant never sees it. Did you ask your assistant to do this? No =
  nothing is stored or changed.* The buttons are **Yes / No** on every platform (the
  macOS, zenity and kdialog buttons are now labelled Yes / No too); "Allow" and
  "Deny" are gone. The project is shown as its last folder name only.
- **Account window** leads with the account: *GitHub account: octo-cat / Is this your
  account?*
- **One question per action.** Replacing a key with no earlier permission is ONE
  window (not a permission window and then a replace window); asking again while a
  window is open never opens another.
- **Time.** Windows stay open 5 minutes (330 s) and say so. If one closes by itself
  the next status is `consent_expired` (and the account window's failure says
  "expired"): the agent is told to tell the person it expired and that they can simply
  ask again. An expired window is not a "no".
- **Windows:** the box is brought to the front and its taskbar button flashes, with the
  system question sound (all best effort; it stays top-most).

## 0.7.3

Fixes from the independent verification of 0.7.2.

- **The keychain is the authority.** `ChainSecret` reads the 0600 file only when the
  keychain returns nothing - never because the file has a "newer" counter - and
  deletes the file once the keychain saves, so a planted `consent.key` cannot take over.
- **A window, when one can be shown, is the only consent.** A permission file on disk
  (even a valid one) is ignored while a window is available; the terminal grant applies
  only with no window, or when the server runs with `OATHKEY_NO_WINDOW=1`.
- **A failing helper is not a "no".** Crashes, odd exit statuses and unsupported flags
  give `None` (`consent_needed`, ask again); only an explicit Deny is remembered.
  zenity is retried without `--no-markup` / `--default-cancel` on old versions; kdialog
  text has `< > &` removed.
- **Refusals are visible.** When a helper is on PATH but is not a trusted (root-owned)
  install, the answer says where it found it and why it was refused. Trust is not widened,
  clipboard tools included (the key passes through them).
- **Hook:** wildcards that could expand to `.oathkey` (`~/.safe*/*`, `.s*/c*`,
  `.saf?easyapi/*`, `tar c ~/.safe*`) are refused; `.*`, `man security` and friends are not.
- Lock: stale limit 180 s, stale locks are renamed away before removal; the consent
  folder is created 0700. macOS: the keychain secret is passed to `security -i` on stdin,
  not in argv. A start that fails as busy or rate-limited keeps the replace permission;
  the window check-and-set is under the lock.

## 0.7.2

Fixes from the second review of 0.7.x.

- **Helpers are trusted ones only.** `zenity`, `kdialog`, `osascript`, `security`,
  `secret-tool` and the clipboard tools are looked up only in `/usr/bin`, `/bin`
  and `/usr/local/bin`, only if root owns them and neither they nor their folder
  are writable by others, and run with a fixed `PATH` and a minimal environment
  (`safeexec.py`).
- **Honest consent.** The window's yes is kept in the server's memory for the
  session, never on disk. The terminal `allow-agent` grant in the signed file is
  advisory (a same-user program can read the secret or fake a terminal); README,
  SKILL.md and docstrings say so. The consent file carries a counter that is also
  kept with the secret, so an old copy no longer verifies; no `.bak` copies; the
  write is under a lock and the secret file is created with `O_EXCL`; a keyring
  that cannot save falls back to the 0600 file; `allow-agent` reports a grant it
  could not save.
- **Second window.** After the vendor accepts the key, a window shows the account
  (GitHub login, `[A-Za-z0-9-]{1,39}` only) and the person confirms before anything
  is stored (`confirming`, `account_confirmed_by_person`).
- **Windows.** The message box has a time limit (a timeout is not a "no" and can be
  asked again); the clipboard getter raises when it cannot open the clipboard.
- **Dialogs:** zenity `--no-markup`, ASCII-only text (look-alike letters become
  `?`), the project path cut to its last 120 characters.
- **Clipboard.** `clear_verified` is false when `clear()` reports failure or the
  clipboard cannot be read back. Strict, anchored (`\Z`, documented length)
  `capture_accept` gates for the services with a documented format.
- **Status:** a pending question makes `status` wait for the answer; an old answer
  expires; `replace_granted` says to pass `replace=true`; `bool("false")` is false.
- **Hook:** the steal rules are also applied to the quote-squashed text; `consent.key`,
  `agent-consent` and the `.oathkey` folder by relative path are protected (speed
  bump, not a lock).
- **setup-agent / skill install:** line ends, BOM and UTF-8 kept; markers must be
  paired and in order; a stale Codex entry is updated; non-text files are refused
  with a reason; shell-correct quoting of the Claude Code command.
- More tests: 94 new (helpers, dialogs, stores, replay, status wait, setup-agent).

## 0.7.1

Fixes from an independent review of 0.7.0 (security, correctness, architecture, tests).

- **Hook:** a quote-split file name (`cat .e''nv`) is now refused like `.env`.
- **Consent cannot be forged by a file edit.** The permission is asked in a window of
  the operating system shown by the MCP server (`dialog.py`; terminal route as the
  weaker fallback), and recorded in `~/.oathkey/agent-consent.json` (home from the
  user database) with an HMAC; the secret lives in DPAPI / the macOS keychain / the
  Linux Secret Service, else a 0600 file marked advisory. A file that does not verify
  is no consent. Corrupt files are kept as `.bak`, never overwritten silently.
- Replacing a stored key needs its own yes in a window; the keychain case is checked
  too; the result names the account (GitHub login).
- Agent writes only the project's `.env` (or a file the grant names); one shared
  `.env`-name rule for writer and hook; public/static/dist folders refused.
- Services without a documented key format answer `unsupported_gateless`; per-field
  gates for two-value services; a copied value must be one line without spaces;
  only a stale value shaped like the service's key is wiped, other clipboard content
  is left alone.
- The clipboard is emptied and verified (`clipboard_warning` instead of a false
  "emptied"), Windows uses the clipboard sequence number, xclip/wl-copy no longer stall.
- States `validating` and `storing`; `status` waits ~25 s and returns on any change;
  `cancel` is honest (`too_late`); a failed arm never leaves the manager busy; server
  shutdown cancels and clears; clipboard-history check fails closed.
- Hook: clipboard readers, and quote/variable-insensitive consent-file and
  `allow-agent` mentions (a speed bump, not the lock).
- Client-neutral rules; `setup-agent` for Claude Code/Desktop, Cursor, Codex, Gemini
  (absolute Python path); `skill install --for cursor|codex|gemini|all`; README
  "what is enforced where".

## 0.7.0

**Agent-driven key capture.** The person says "connect GitHub"; the agent opens
the key page, makes the key and clicks the vendor's Copy button; oathkey
takes the key from the clipboard, empties it, tests it, stores it, and tells the
agent only `stored`. Nobody opens a terminal, copies or pastes; the key is never
in the chat or on screen.

- New MCP tool `capture_key` (`start` / `status` / `cancel`), `oathkey/capture.py`.
  Background capture in the server process; one at a time; 10-180 s; six starts
  an hour; built-in recipes only; only a *changed*, key-shaped (service-shaped
  when the recipe has a format) clipboard value; the old clipboard is wiped; the
  clipboard is emptied the moment a key is taken; a rejected or unstorable key is
  kept nowhere; results hold state words, variable names, where stored and a
  length class - never the key or a part of it.
- New `oathkey allow-agent <service>` (`--revoke`, `--list`,
  `--allow-clipboard-history`): the person's one-time yes, typed in a terminal,
  kept in `~/.oathkey/agent-consent.json` (not in the project, where an
  agent could edit it). The hook refuses an agent running it.
- Windows clipboard history on: `capture_key` refuses unless the person accepted
  it when granting; the answer says so.
- `request_connect` now returns `browser` steps (from the recipe, least privilege,
  short expiry) and `rules` (never read the key field, never type it, only click
  Copy, never enter passwords/2FA/CAPTCHA - stop and ask the person). SKILL.md,
  README and the hook messages now say: use `capture_key`; ask the person to run
  `connect` only when capture is unavailable. `connect --clipboard` is unchanged.

Not tested against a real Windows/macOS clipboard in CI: the tests use a fake
clipboard and a fake vendor. See the README ("Agent-driven capture").

## 0.6.3

- **Security / UX.** The question after a key was taken from the clipboard
  ("Is that the key?") echoed whatever was typed or pasted, and a person who
  pasted the key there saw it on screen and had it accepted. Now:
  - the question is read without echo (a password-style read; from a pipe it
    shows nothing either), and the rest of a multi-line paste is discarded;
  - only Enter, y and n answer it; anything long or key-shaped is refused with
    "That looked like a key. Do not paste it here. Nothing was saved.", is not
    kept, and the question is asked again (three tries, then cancelled);
  - the wording says the key is already taken, hidden, and not to paste.
  - the same reader is used for the y/N questions that can follow a key: the
    plain-text `.env` fallback of `--store keychain`, `export`, and
    `scan --validate`.
  - the hidden paste prompt drops terminal paste markers and leftover lines.

## 0.6.2

Fixes for what the test matrix (Linux, macOS, Windows; Python 3.10-3.14) found.

- `run`: Ctrl-C that lands while the output readers are still starting no
  longer ends in "could not acquire lock for <stdout> at interpreter shutdown"
  (exit -6) or a traceback; the interrupt is held until the readers are up,
  every reader is finished before `run` leaves, and the child is never left
  running. Exit status is 130 as documented.
- MCP: JSON nested more than 200 levels deep is a Parse error (-32700) on every
  Python version; before, Python 3.14 could parse it and the reply was
  Invalid params (-32602). A reply nested deeper than that is likewise an
  Internal error on every Python (macOS 3.14 could write it).
- Hook: a `oathkey` program in the current folder is never used as the hook
  command, also when the folder has another spelling (macOS `/var` and
  `/private/var`, links, Windows case and short names).
- `detect` does not read a symbolic link on Windows (no `O_NOFOLLOW` there).
- Tests only: Windows-aware hook, symlink, file-mode and own-recipe tests.

## 0.6.1

Fixes from an independent review of 0.6.0.

**Security**
- A redirect from a query-auth check (OpenWeather, your own recipes) no longer
  prints the address with the key in it: only scheme, host and path are shown,
  and every validation error is scrubbed of the key and its encodings.
- The hook also refuses `oathkey run --no-redact`, keychain readers
  (`secret-tool`, `security find-generic-password`, `cmdkey`, `Get-Secret`,
  `keyring`), `/proc/*/environ` and `~/.oathkey`. `run --no-redact` is
  refused unless input and output are a terminal. Agent-facing text now says
  "ask the person to run it". README states plainly what an agent that can
  use `run` can still do.
- `.env` writes take a lock (20 parallel writers used to leave 7 keys), the
  read no longer follows a link swapped in after the check, and a result is
  re-read after writing.
- A manifest's `env_file` must be a `.env`-style name inside the project;
  `oathkey.json` is only looked for up to the git project's top folder
  (or the folder itself); `--project-dir` names it explicitly. `connect`,
  `rotate`, `forget` and `export` use the manifest's env file like `run`.
- The MCP output guard blanks only secret-looking values (not ordinary
  settings) and never member names. `needs_keys` stays inside the project;
  `request_connect` opens at most 3 key pages a minute in all.
- Recipe patterns that could run for ages on crafted input are refused.
- `doctor-recipes` never visits private addresses (also not through a
  redirect), and each service has a time budget. The weekly workflow pins its
  actions by commit.
- A recipe that sends the key to localhost or a private network asks you to
  confirm first. `export` names the repository / Vercel project it will send
  to, taken from the git remote / `.vercel`, and uses it explicitly.

**Behaviour**
- Copy-and-go: a stale key-shaped value is emptied, a second identical Copy is
  noticed, Ctrl-C cancels, the clipboard is emptied after the prompt fallback,
  host:port, paths, e-mail addresses and plain words are not taken as keys,
  and a key with no documented shape is confirmed (length only).
- AWS: a clock more than 5 minutes off is reported as that, not as a dead key.
- OpenAI: a 403 is "real key with limits", not a dead one.
- Redaction also catches upper and lower case forms.
- `oathkey skill install` copies the agent skill (now shipped in the wheel).

## 0.6.0

One flow from the vendor's key page into your project, and the agent never
touches a key.

**Recipes (all 36 re-checked against the vendors' own documentation)**
- Two separate ideas for a key's shape: `accept` (what `--clipboard` will
  take: only documented shapes, matched from the start, so a valid key is never
  refused - removed for Groq, Hugging Face, OpenAI, OpenRouter, SendGrid, Tavily,
  GitHub, Vercel and Cloudflare) and `detect` (what `scan` looks for: the
  commonly used shapes are kept, labelled "format is a guess"). The old
  `pattern` still works. Fixes a bug where a prefix-only gate would have been
  matched against the whole key.
- Keys that are real but limited are no longer "dead": `validate.limited` (a
  403 from a Stripe restricted key, a Supabase / Vercel / GitHub fine-grained /
  SendGrid token without that permission) and `validate.body_rules` (Resend's
  401 `restricted_api_key`). `connect` stores the key and says what it cannot do.
- `least_privilege` (shown by `connect`) and `unverified` (parts the docs do
  not confirm, shown by `connect`) on the recipes.
- Corrections: AWS uses the documented STS POST; OpenRouter checks `/api/v1/key`
  and wants a credit limit; eBay and Spotify are judged by the token call alone;
  Cohere `/v1/models`; PayPal live and `paypal-sandbox` are separate; Mailgun asks
  for the main account key; Postmark a server token; GitHub recommends
  fine-grained tokens; ElevenLabs, Vercel and Notion key pages; many "starts
  with ..." claims the vendors never made are gone; OpenWeather's two-hour
  delay and Brave's plan requirement are said plainly.
- `scan` also finds Supabase `sb_secret_` keys.

**New commands**
- `doctor-recipes`: visits each recipe's key page, docs and test server over
  HTTPS with no key and reports moved or gone pages (exit 1 on rot). A weekly
  GitHub Action keeps one issue up to date. `CONTRIBUTING.md` and a pull
  request template ask for a docs link and a fake-key test. A real run found
  three moved pages, now fixed.
- `init`, `setup`, `status` and `oathkey.json` (names only, committed):
  detect the services a project uses (never opening a real `.env`), connect every
  missing one in order (skipping those already stored, resumable), and list where
  each key lives and how old it is, with a rotate hint after 90 days (a small
  local record holds dates, never keys).
- `run` reads the keychain or the `.env` file, `--all` injects every service in
  the manifest, and the program's output is scrubbed of the key by default
  (`--redact`; exact value, base64, hex, URL- and JSON-encoded forms;
  `--no-redact` to turn it off). The limits are in the README.
- `export <service> --to github|vercel`: through `gh secret set` / `vercel env
  add`, with the key on standard input only, never in a command line.
- MCP tools `request_connect` and `needs_keys`: the agent asks, the person runs
  `oathkey connect` in their own terminal. Answers hold names and statuses
  only; a second filter blanks any reachable secret. The hook message and the new
  `skills/oathkey/SKILL.md` point agents at this.
- Windows: `--clipboard` falls back to the hidden prompt when clipboard history
  (Win+V) is on, because the history keeps a copy this tool cannot remove
  (`--allow-clipboard-history` overrides).
- Error messages no longer repeat an unknown service or tool name that is long
  or odd (it could be a key pasted in the wrong place).

**Tests** run with no real network at all: any connection that is not to
127.0.0.1 fails the test.

## 0.5.2

- The hook now also covers `Edit`, `Write`, `MultiEdit` and `NotebookEdit`:
  they are refused for a real `.env` file (a key the agent writes has passed
  through the agent, and a `Write` can overwrite yours). Templates
  (`.env.example` ...) stay writable. The agent is told "Claude can't write to
  .env - your keys stay out of the chat. Run: oathkey connect <service>
  (or edit the file yourself)."
- `OATHKEY_HOOK_ALLOW_WRITE=1` (in Claude Code's environment) allows
  those writes; reads stay refused.
- `hook install` upgrades an older install's matcher in place (only our own
  entry); `hook status` says OUTDATED when the matcher is the old one.

## 0.5.1

Fixes from a security review of 0.5.0.

- `scan` can no longer be made to hang: the `NAME=value` pattern was
  quadratic (20,000 `A`s on one line took 9-26 seconds, a 1 MB file ten
  minutes). Every pattern now runs on bounded pieces of a line, each file has
  a 10-second budget, and a long minified line is scanned in 8 KB pieces
  instead of being cut off after 20,000 characters.
- `scan` no longer says "no keys found" after a partial look. Only files that
  will be read count toward the limits (an agent file behind 50,000 empty
  files is found), build output (`target`, `build`, `dist`, `.next` ...) is
  skipped, and when any limit is hit (too many files or folders, too deep, a
  folder or agent file that could not be read, out of time) the report says
  `INCOMPLETE` and the exit status is 2 (`--fail-on` never gives a clean 0).
  JSON has `incomplete`; SARIF has a notification.
- `scan --validate`: a key found only by its variable name is no longer sent
  to the service its name suggests unless it has that service's key format
  (a wrong guess used to send a key to the wrong vendor and then say "delete
  the line"). Only a 401 means rejected, now worded "rejected ... may not be
  an X key; rotate it if you are unsure"; a 403 is "could not be checked".
  Names with `webhook`, `anon`, `maps` or `public` are never matched to a
  service. With no terminal and no `--yes` the report is still printed (keys
  "not checked") instead of being dropped.
- `scan` uses only the recipes shipped in the package. Your own recipes in
  `~/.oathkey/recipes` (their regular expression and the host a key is
  sent to) are used only with the new `--my-recipes`, under a timer, and with
  `--validate` they need a typed `y` every time, even with `--yes`.
- `scan` finds more: a PEM private key on one line inside JSON, a password in
  a connection URL, `*_PASSWORD` names, an unnamed `Bearer <token>`, Slack and
  Discord webhook URLs, Stripe `whsec_` secrets, and UTF-16 `.env` files
  (what PowerShell's `>` writes). A stand-in is recognised by word, not by
  letters inside a key, so real keys containing `abc123` or `fake` are no
  longer thrown away. Trailing `.`, `-`, `_` are no longer part of a match
  ("the key is sk-...abc." redacts and validates the key, not the full stop).
  The same file reached through a link is reported once, under its real path;
  the "skipped" line states the real reasons.
- `hook status` no longer runs a command read from a settings file (a cloned
  repository's `.claude/settings.json` could run anything). It tests only the
  command this installation would write, without a shell.
- The hook now also covers PowerShell and Monitor (it missed both). `hook
  check` reads all of its input however big; input too big or not JSON is
  searched for a `.env` name as text. New `hook install --fail-closed`
  (`onFailure: block`, Claude Code 2.1.295+).
- The hook is recognised by a `statusMessage` marker or by the exact command
  0.5.0 wrote, not by "ends with hook check". It always installs into a group
  of its own; another group's matcher and handlers are never edited.
- Windows: the hook is written in the documented exec form (`command` +
  `args`) so a backslash or space in the path survives Git Bash and
  PowerShell; `--shell-form` is the fallback for an older Claude Code. The
  self-test starts the hook the way Claude Code does (no shell). Not run on a
  real Windows machine - see the README.
- Settings are written through a symbolic link; every change gets its own
  backup in `~/.oathkey/backups` (not once, and not inside the project).
- The release workflow now requires the tagged commit to be on `main`, the
  tests to pass first, the sdist's own tests to pass, and has time limits.
- README: what the hook does NOT stop; what `--fail-on live` does with keys
  that could not be checked.

## 0.5.0

- New: `oathkey scan [PATH]` finds API keys that leaked into files an AI
  agent can read (`.env*`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`,
  `.cursorrules`, the `.claude` folder, `.mcp.json`) and says, for each one,
  where it is and what to do. Offline by default; a key is shown as at most
  its first 4 and last 2 characters; stand-in values are ignored. It skips
  `.git`, `node_modules`, binaries, files over 1 MB, pipes, devices and links
  leading outside the folder.
- `scan --validate` asks each key's own service whether it still works
  (`live` / `dead` / `unknown`). It prints the host first and needs a `y` or
  `--yes`; https only; a check on another domain still needs a typed `yes`.
- `scan --json`, `--sarif` (SARIF 2.1.0), `--fail-on live|any`, `--all`.
  Exit status 0 clean, 1 keys found, 2 could not run.
- New: `oathkey hook install | uninstall | status` adds a Claude Code
  PreToolUse hook that refuses Read, Grep and Bash calls touching `.env`
  files (templates like `.env.example` are allowed). It merges into
  `~/.claude/settings.json` (or `--project`), never overwrites other hooks,
  and is safe to run twice. `hook check` is the hook itself.
- The built-in key formats are now also used to recognise a key anywhere in
  a file, not only on the clipboard.

## 0.4.2

- Safer on Windows: `icacls` is started from the Windows System32 folder and
  `gh` (for `--via-cli`) by its full path, never from the current folder, so a
  cloned repository cannot slip in a program of its own.
- The `.env` file is locked to its owner before the key is written into it,
  not after.
- After saving to `.env`, a warning if the file is inside a git repository and
  not ignored by it.
- `--store keychain` no longer falls back to a plain-text `.env` on its own:
  it asks `[y/N]` (default no) and, with no terminal to ask on, saves nothing
  and exits 1. A key stored in the keychain is read back to confirm it is there.
- A recipe of your own in `~/.oathkey/recipes` that replaces a built-in
  one is now announced in `list` and at the start of `connect`.
- Copy-and-go never takes a link as the key, says plainly that the clipboard
  is emptied, and 8 built-in recipes (OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Hugging Face,
  Replicate, SendGrid, Tavily, OpenRouter) recognise their own key format.
- A folder named `.env` is refused before the browser opens.
- Packaging: GitHub Actions run the tests on Linux, Windows and macOS (Python
  3.10, 3.12, 3.14) and build the package; tagged releases publish to PyPI.
  `.gitattributes` keeps line endings consistent. Python 3.14 and the three
  operating systems are listed in the package metadata.

## 0.4.1

- The public-API list ignores a cache dated in the future.
- Recipes saved with a byte-order mark load.
- Windows device names (`nul`, `con`, ...) are refused as recipe names.
- `forget` looks the Secret Service entry up first.
- HTTP error responses are closed.

## 0.4.0

- Copy-and-go (`--clipboard`), two-value credentials, every common check
  (headers, basic, field, query, OAuth2 client credentials, AWS SigV4),
  `--via-cli`, 6 new recipes.

## 0.3.3

- Recipes may contain non-breaking spaces and emoji; closed standard streams
  give one line; `forget` says what it removed.

## 0.3.2

- `.env` values that are safe to `source`; hostile recipe text is escaped;
  validation uses GET/HEAD only; keychain timeouts; public-suffix heuristics.

## 0.3.1

- Byte-exact `.env` saves, no writes through links, CRLF and duplicate keys,
  international host names, MCP error codes, closed pipes on Windows.

## 0.3.0

- Registrable-domain comparison, safer key saving, `forget`, 25 verified
  recipes.

## 0.2.0

- Stops redirect key leaks, private `.env` writes, install layout fix, OS
  keychain storage.
